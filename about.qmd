Hey! I'm a data scientist, R developer, and sports enthusiast. I am currently doing a master's degree in teleinformatics engineering in the area of pattern recognition. I work in research involving the area of precision beekeeping and seed technology. In my happiest moments, I analyze data ranging from sports to games.
